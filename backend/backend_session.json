    "description": "You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.\n\nFind two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.\n\nReturn _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.\n\n**Notice** that you may not slant the container.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** height = \\[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7\\]\n**Output:** 49\n**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array \\[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7\\]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** height = \\[1,1\\]\n**Output:** 1\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == height.length`\n*   `2 <= n <= 105`\n*   `0 <= height[i] <= 104`"
