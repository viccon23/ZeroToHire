      "content": "Sure, I understand you want the solution. Here's how you can find the first and last position of an element in a sorted array: ### Explanation: 1. Binary Search for First Position: We'll use binary search to find the first occurrence of the target element. If the target is found, we'll keep moving left to ensure we get the first position. 2. Binary Search for Last Position: Similarly, we'll use binary search to find the last occurrence of the target element. If the target is found, we'll keep moving right to ensure we get the last position. ### Code in Python: ```python def findFirstAndLastPosition: def binarySearchFirst: left, right = 0, len - 1 result = -1 while left <= right: mid = // 2 if nums[mid] == target: result = mid right = mid - 1 elif nums[mid] < target: left = mid + 1 else: right = mid - 1 return result def binarySearchLast: left, right = 0, len - 1 result = -1 while left <= right: mid = // 2 if nums[mid] == target: result = mid left = mid + 1 elif nums[mid] < target: left = mid + 1 else: right = mid - 1 return result first_position = binarySearchFirst last_position = binarySearchLast return [first_position, last_position] # Example usage: nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10] target = 8 print) # Output: [3, 4] ``` This code defines two helper functions, `binarySearchFirst` and `binarySearchLast`, to find the first and last positions of the target element, respectively. The main function `findFirstAndLastPosition` uses these helper functions and returns the results. If you have any questions about this solution, feel free to ask!",
